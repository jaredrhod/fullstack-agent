"""ai-visualizer server. Python standard library only, nothing to install.

Serves the face gallery at http://127.0.0.1:8790/ and exposes:

  /state   polled by the faces (~8x/sec):
           {"state":  "idle|listening|thinking|speaking",
            "level":  0.0-1.0,       voice loudness while speaking
            "samples": [64 floats],  raw waveform snapshot (0s when quiet)
            "alert":  bool,          optional attention signal
            "loading": bool}         true while the voice line plays its
                                     own thinking sound (we stay quiet)
  /config  the merged ai-visualizer.json plus the list of installed
           faces, discovered by scanning the faces/ folder. Drop a new
           folder with an index.html into faces/ and it appears in the
           gallery. That is the whole plugin system.

READ-ONLY on the signal bus. The bus is three tiny files written by a
voice line (backtalk writes them natively, github.com/jaredrhod/backtalk):

  .voice_state        idle | listening | thinking | speaking
  .voice_waveform     JSON {ts, samples: [64 floats]} while audio plays
  .voice_loading_pid  exists while the voice line plays a thinking sound
  .voice_alert        optional: non-empty file = attention needed

Where the bus lives comes from "bus_dir" in ai-visualizer.json (default:
this folder). Point it at your backtalk folder, or point backtalk's
"signals_dir" here. Either direction works.

Run:
  python3 server.py             the real bus
  python3 server.py --mock speaking
                                no voice line needed: /state synthesizes
                                the chosen state (idle|listening|thinking
                                |speaking) so you can see a face perform
  python3 server.py --no-open   do not auto-open the browser
Ctrl-C stops.
